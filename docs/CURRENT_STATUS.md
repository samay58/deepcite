# Current Status of Athena DeepCite

## Overview

Athena DeepCite is currently in a transition state. We've created a plan for refactoring but haven't fully implemented it yet. The documentation in the `docs/` directory outlines the future architecture and implementation steps.

## Current Files

The main codebase consists of:

- **contentScript.ts** - Main content script that runs in the browser
- **background.ts** - Background service worker for API calls
- **llmExtractor.ts** - Class for LLM-based claim extraction
- **types.ts** - Shared type definitions
- **options.html/ts** - Settings page (future functionality)
- **styles/pdf-overlay.css** - Styling for the extension

## Recent Improvements

We've made several enhancements to the extension:

1. **Manual Activation** - Analysis now only runs when the user explicitly clicks the "Analyze Webpage" or "Analyze PDF" button
2. **Fact Certainty Filtering** - Only claims with a fact certainty score above 40% are highlighted and displayed
3. **Visual Certainty Indicators** - Added visual meters to show the confidence score for each claim
4. **Unified Claims Panel** - Added a consistent side panel for both web pages and PDFs that shows all detected claims
5. **Modern UI** - Refreshed the visual design with more elegant animations, color scheme, and interactions
6. **Interactive Navigation** - Claims in the panel can be clicked to navigate to their location in the text

## How to Test

Please refer to `docs/TESTING.md` for detailed instructions on testing the extension.

## Refactoring Plans

We've created a comprehensive refactoring plan in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and architectural details in `docs/REFACTORING.md`. The key points are:

1. Move to a modular architecture
2. Add webpack for bundling
3. Improve separation of concerns
4. Centralize configuration
5. Enhance code documentation

## Current Challenges

The main challenge is that Chrome extensions have specific limitations that affect our refactoring:

1. Module support is limited in Manifest V3
2. Direct imports between content and background scripts aren't possible
3. Message passing needs careful handling with complex data structures

## Next Steps

To continue development:

1. Review the implementation plan
2. Set up webpack for bundling
3. Follow the phased approach in the implementation plan
