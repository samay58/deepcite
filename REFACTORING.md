# Athena DeepCite Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the restructuring changes made in Iteration 6 to improve the organization and maintainability of the codebase.

## Directory Structure Changes

The codebase has been reorganized into a more modular structure:

```
/src/
  /extractors/     - Claim extraction strategies
    contentExtractor.ts  - Rule-based claim extraction
    llmExtractor.ts      - AI-powered claim extraction
  /handlers/       - Document type-specific handlers
    pdfHandler.ts        - PDF document processing
    pdfAnalyzer.ts       - PDF UI and analysis
    webPageHandler.ts    - Web page UI and analysis
  /utils/          - Shared utilities
    settingsManager.ts   - API key and settings management
  types.ts         - Core type definitions and interfaces
  background.ts    - Background service worker 
  contentScript.ts - Main entry point for content script
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns

- **PDFHandler**: Separated PDF-specific logic into its own handler
- **WebPageHandler**: Isolated web page-specific handling
- **Content Script**: Reduced to a lightweight coordinator that delegates to the appropriate handlers

### 2. Interface-based Design

- Created the `IClaimExtractor` interface to standardize claim extraction
- Both `ContentExtractor` and `LLMExtractor` now implement this interface
- This enables easy swapping or addition of new extraction strategies in the future

### 3. Centralized Configuration

- Created a `settingsManager.ts` utility to manage:
  - API key retrieval and storage
  - API endpoint configuration
  - Memory caching for better performance

### 4. Enhanced Message Handling

- Background script now uses a switch-case pattern for message routing
- Each message type has its own handler function
- Makes adding new message types easier in the future

### 5. Developer Tools

- Added ESLint for TypeScript
- Configured linting rules
- Added npm scripts for building and linting

### 6. Path Mapping

- Updated tsconfig.json with path aliases:
  - `@handlers/*`
  - `@extractors/*`
  - `@utils/*`
  - `@types`

## Benefits

1. **Maintainability**: Smaller, focused files are easier to understand and modify
2. **Extensibility**: New extractors or handlers can be added with minimal changes to existing code
3. **Team Development**: Clear separation makes it easier for multiple developers to work concurrently
4. **Testing**: Modular structure facilitates unit testing of individual components
5. **Documentation**: Code organization now better reflects the logical architecture

## Next Steps

1. Complete migration to the new structure:
   - Update any remaining imports to use path aliases
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing features

2. Consider adding unit tests:
   - Jest or other testing frameworks can be added to test individual components

3. Future feature additions:
   - New message types can be added to background.ts
   - New extraction strategies can implement the IClaimExtractor interface
   - New document type handlers can be added to the handlers directory
